# Standups
A history of my standups.

## Today
### 3/2/23
Yesterday
- I worked on a couple of tech debt stories: 1175 and 1019. 1175 is adding a new shared enum for Display Types of Controls like date, checkbox, textfield, and others. 1019 is cleaning up the add control dialog.
- Also had the Frontend Guild meeting but not much content there.

Today
- I will continue working on 1019.
- I was looking through all of the UX designs yesterday afternoon and found some differences in the design and the current UI, so I'll also make those minor changes in the same PR as well.

- After that, I'll work on pushing the code up to the master branch and writing some documentation on the wiki

### 4/27/21
Yesterday
- Added a new logic so in case of a failed test, the test should always log out if the user is still signed in
- Added an additional feature to the filtering of the card so that when you don't configure what kind of cards to interact with, that filtering function is ignored
- Continued on adding more modularity to interactions with the cards but had some errors and I realized that some of the common cards aren't in the exact same architecture for the different entities so I just put in a fix for that

Today

- Worked on clearing the unmanaged alarms
- Also finished up creation of new channels when configured

Today
- I ran some tests in the morning and it looked like the new features broke a few things so I'll have to chase that down

- Combined all of the previous tasks and ran a big load test to make sure everything was working fine

Today
- I'm going to run a test on the VM since I was previously having trouble with that and see how that goes
- I'll probably be facing some issues so if I can solve that, I'll move on to the documentation of the tool and getting ready to push the final version up soon

### 4/16/21
Yesterday
- Spent most of the day debugging a lot of the small issues that I've been holding off to fix for a while now
- Some of them took longer than expected but most of it should be done
- Still have a couple of more things on the list that I need to validate and/or fix
- But I also added a hard exception handling that can catch any error and then refresh the page if needed to restart the test at any time

- Austin seems like he is getting pretty far with Alarms so I'm going to implement the Common Logging for the frontend for Alarms and Assets

### 3/31/21
Yesterday
- Continued to work on the front end side of the end to end performance test
- Finished up implementation for interacting with units and notifications
- Started working on the map at the end of the day but could not figure out how I can move on the map with either drag and drop or arrow keys

- Will do more research on that. Have some ideas on what I can try but if it doesn't work, will go ahead and get started on the 2nd half of the interactions which will be alarms, assets, and devices

### 3/30/21
Yesterday
- Started working on refactoring the front end performance test according to the discussion from last Friday in the sync up meeting
- There was a good bit of changes I needed to make then I thought so that took longer than I expected but I did get a really good foundation to build on top of today and also finish all of the incident interactions

Today

- Start working on interacting with the map

### 3/29/21
Friday
- Had a meeting for the performance test with Mark and Joshua to teach us the dynamic duo or the youngins I forget what Mark calls us but we talked about the devices and how other capabilities work with that
- Started working on a plan going forward and how all of the front end automations will work
- Set up a workspace and the tabs specifically designed for the load test
- Also implemented assets and alarms reading from the console on my end just so I can focus the user interactions for today

### 3/24/21
Yesterday
- Worked on some minor bug fixes and cleaned up some code for the performance test tool
Pushed that to the repo but had some build issues and I think Joshua is going to try and make an
exclusion if he has time
- In the afternoon, met with Austin and trying to figure out how I can add a manual trigger to end the test anytime
- That implementation took longer than I thought but did get that finished
- This morning, I removed the entityID attributes from the DOM that I added last sprint for incidents, units, and devices since there is no need for that now

Today
- Look into the build issues like I said earlier

- Finished functions for switching tenants, workspaces, presets and tabs
- Finished up all of the metrics that I could think of to print out in a log file and also the configurations
- Research any ways that I can trigger the unit test to end at any time but couldn't find any way so ended just simply adding the date to the end time configuration so running the test for multiple days should be possible now

Today
- Finish up automations for interacting with incidents and units
- Planning to run a small load test so I can test all of the things that I worked on Friday and see if I can improve and prepare for the big load test soon

### 3/19/21
Yesterday
- Worked on hardening the load test tool specifically on the data reading aspect
- Got to run a small load test with Austin for incidents and units concurrently and that seemed to work perfectly

Today
- I'm going to finish up reading from the data from the console
- And start on the hardening for that since Austin seems like he's in a good spot

### 3/16/21
Yesterday
- Worked on recording the incident data from the console
- Took me longer than I expected just because I had to combine the SignalR response I get and the API calls from the HTTP response but I think I have that finished

Today
- Will run some tests to make sure incidents data is caught and stored correctly
- Move onto units but that shouldn't take a long time
- Continue to work on the frontend automations

Today
- This morning, I will finish up recording of the data
- Adding more configurations to the test
- And continue adding more automation scripts

### 3/12/21
Yesterday
- Worked on a lot of the refactoring for the automation script
- Started testing for incidents, basically done with that
- Still not seeing Jeremy's changes on the dev for the console logs, so Jeremy if you could take a look at that sometime today if you have time, that'll be great. I could also be doing something wrong so not sure why.
- Also had group testing for notifications
- Mark, the issue you encountered with yesterday at the notifications group testing where you expand on a unit and you can't scroll down afterwards, we said that was only for units on staging, but I noticed it was there on incidents also on dev this morning. Don't know how helpful that is but wanted to let you know.

Today
