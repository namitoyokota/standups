- Yesterday, I worked on 1189 which was moving the API service files to a new directory and then 1170 for refactoring our current moment.js code to start using date-fns.
- Today, I'm working on 1175 to create a new enum to store display types for controls, then will work on 1019 which is cleaning up the UI for the add control dialog. I was looking through all of the UX designs yesterday afternoon and found some differences in the design and the current UI, so I'll also make those minor changes in the same PR as well.
